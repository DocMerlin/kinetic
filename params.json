If you use more than one instance per-shard then you will\r\nhit the AWS Kinesis throughput [limits](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html).\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\nBefore using kinetic, you should make sure you have a created a Kinesis stream and your configuration file has the credentails necessary to read and write to the stream. Once this stream exists in AWS, kinetic will ensure it is in the \"ACTIVE\" state before running.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nTests are written using [goconvey](http://goconvey.co/) and [kinesalite](https://github.com/mhart/kinesalite). Make sure you have kinesalite running locally before attempting to run the tests. They can be run either via the comamnd line:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ go test -v -cover -race\r\n```\r\n\r\nor via web interface:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ goconvey\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Running\r\nKinetic can be used to interface with kinesis like so:\r\n\r\n\r\n```go\r\nimport \"github.com/rewardStyle/kinetic\"\r\n\r\nlistener, _ := new(kinetic.Listener).Init(\"your-stream\", 0)\r\nproducer, _ := new(kinetic.Producer).Init(\"your-stream\", 0)\r\n\r\nproducer.Send(new(kinetic.Message).Init([]byte(`{\"foo\":\"bar\"}`), \"test\"))\r\n\r\n// Using Retrieve\r\nmsg, err := listener.Retrieve()\r\nif err != nil {\r\n    t.Fatalf(err.Error())\r\n}\r\n\r\nprintln(string(msg))\r\n\r\n// Using Listen - will block unless sent in goroutine\r\ngo listener.Listen(func(msg []byte, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {\r\n    println(string(msg))\r\n    wg.Done()\r\n})\r\n\r\nproducer.Send(new(KinesisMessage).Init([]byte(`{\"foo\":\"bar\"}`), \"test\"))\r\n\r\nlistener.Close()\r\nproducer.Close()\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more examples take a look at the tests.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
